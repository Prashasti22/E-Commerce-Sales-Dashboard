# E-Commerce Sales Dashboard

## Problem Statement

A US-based e-commerce sales company needs a sales dashboard to visualize YTD Sales and gain insights into various scenarios. The dashboard should allow stakeholders to:

- View key KPIs like YTD Sales, YTD Profit, Quantity Sold, and Profit Margin.
- Track year-over-year (YoY) growth and monthly trends for each KPI with sparklines.
- Analyze YTD Sales, PYTD Sales, and YoY Sales growth for different customer categories, using trend icons.
- Assess sales performance by state and region, identifying top-performing areas.
- Identify the top 5 and bottom 5 products based on sales.
- Determine the best and worst performing regions and understand the impact of different shipping types.


## Project Overview 

This project involves building a comprehensive Power BI dashboard to visualize and analyze sales data for a US-based e-commerce company. The goal is to provide insights on Year-to-Date (YTD) Sales, Profit, and other key performance indicators (KPIs) to support data-driven decision-making. By connecting to SQL data, performing data cleaning, and leveraging DAX measures, this dashboard helps the company monitor and enhance its sales and customer satisfaction.

## Project Steps

### 1. Data Import and Cleaning
- Connect to Data Sources: Import data from MS SQL Server and flat files.

- Data Cleaning: Use Power Query to clean and preprocess the data, ensuring accuracy and consistency.

### 2. Data Modeling
- Create Relationships: Model data by linking three primary tables.

- Create Date Table: Build a Date Table in Power BI for effective time-based analysis.

- Apply Time Intelligence Functions: Use functions like TOTALYTD and SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR to calculate time-based metrics.

### 3. KPI and Metric Calculations

- Develop KPI Banners: Create banners for key metrics such as YTD Sales, YTD Profit, Quantity Sold, and Profit Margin.

- Calculate YoY Growth and Monthly Trends: Implement sparklines to display monthly trends for each KPI, providing visual insights.

- Dynamic KPI Creation: Use DAX functions like Calculate, Sum, Sumx, Filter, and others to calculate complex KPIs.

### 4. Visualizations and Insights

- Build Visuals for Key Insights: Charts and maps to visualize performance by region and product.

- Trend icons and conditional formatting for growth and performance metrics.

- Analyze Product Performance: Identify top and bottom 5 products based on sales.

- Regional Analysis: Analyze YTD Sales performance by state and region, highlighting the best and worst performing areas.

- Shipping Analysis: Show YTD Sales by shipping type to identify the most efficient shipping methods.
### 5. Dashboard Design and Formatting

- Create Interactive Visuals: Design charts, maps, and KPI cards for user-friendly interaction.

- Apply Conditional Formatting: Use dynamic icons and color schemes to highlight performance insights.
